Step 1 Prompt: This is my module’s starter graph code modify it by adding DFS and BFS functions inside the graph class.

Step 2 Prompt: N/A

Step 3 Initial Prompt: this is my C++ graph code. Can you turn it into some kind of real-world application? Maybe make the graph represent something like airports or something, and just adjust the output so it prints nicer. You can change the printGraph function and the DFS.

Step 3 Updated Prompt: This is my C++ graph program. I need to wrap a real-world airline application around this graph.
please do the following without changing the structure of my graph class the edges or the DFS/BFS algorithms:
 add a list of airport names for each node.
 modify printGraph() so it prints airport to airport connections and flight durations
 modify DFS so it describes an airline inspection route starting at the chosen airport
for the BFS part change the print statements so it sounds like we’re checking which airports can be reached by taking connecting flights

Step 4 prompt: Now I need to add a feature that gives the shortest travel times from airport 0 to all the other airports in my graph. add a new function inside the graph class that calculates the shortest routes based on the flight time weights already in the adjaclist.
the function should print something like shortest time from sfo to miami is x minutes.
keep all my existing DFS/BFS code the same.

Step 5 prompt: Now I need to add another feature I want my graph program to print out a minimum spanning tree using the flight times in the graph. please add a new function inside the graph class that finds a set of edges that connects all the airports with the minimum total flight time.make the function print the connections in a readable way like: SFO to SEA (8 mins) please don’t change my existing DFS/BFS/shortest path code just add the new MST function and show me where to call it in main.

Step 6 prompt: N/A
